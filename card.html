			<p>The mature B. smithi has a dark-colored body with orange patches on the joints of its legs. The second element of the legs is orange-red. Following molting, the colors are more pronounced. The dark portion is very black, while the orange-red portions are far more on the reddish side.</p>

			<p>An adult male has a body roughly 4 in long, with a leg span of 6 in, and a mass around 15 g. Both sexes are similar in appearance, with the male having a smaller body, but longer legs. Though the male is of comparable size to the female, the male has a much smaller mass.</p>
